Examples
---------
- Add command line examples (-x)
- Add PdPatch/PdObject examples, how to select and modify


Object IDs
----------
Connect objects are troublesome as they refer to object ids. Inserting/deletion
will require modifying the connect objects. Can't see any way around this. In
fact it's one of the features the project can offer. It's worth having this
baked in so you don't have to think of it when writing quick scripts.

- Assign bi-directional references from connect objects to the sources and
  destinations.
- The object-ids in the connection object can then be ignored on insert/delete.
- The source and destination object-ids can be regenerated when re-writing
  the patch.


Write
-----
- Add support for rewriting modify patch files.


Parse Recursive Abstractions
----------------------------
- Add the current patch's path into search list
- Descend through the external abstractions until are no more left
- This gives the bulk of what is needed to generate stand-alone patches with
  all included dependencies.


Declare
-------
- Add support for declare -path -stdpath -lib -stdlib
    -path add to search path (relative to patch)
    -stdpath add to search path (relative to PD installation)
    -lib load library (relative to patch)
    -stdlib load library (relative to PD installation)


Import
------
- Add support for import statement. To properly support this we need to extract
  the exported symbols by the external library. Python ctypes should help, but
  can't see a way of reading the exported symbols ala unix nm.
